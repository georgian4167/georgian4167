      <h2>COVID-19 Information</h2>
      <p>COVID-19 is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
      <p>The virus is primarily spread through respiratory droplets when an infected person talks, coughs, or sneezes. It can also be spread by touching a surface or object contaminated with the virus and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of COVID-19 can range from mild to severe, and may include fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, body aches, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, and congestion or runny nose.</p>
      <p>If you think you may have COVID-19, it is important to get tested and follow the advice of your healthcare provider.</p>
